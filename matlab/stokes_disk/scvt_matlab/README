This matlab code generated a spherical cvt (SCVT) for 
two concentric spheres. 

The driver is scvt_test.m

Use of kdtree (provided by the matlab fileexechange: 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21512)
is limited to searching for nearest generators when performing
a probabilistic lloyd's algorithm. 



TO USE: 
==========

start matlab in the directory where scvt_test.m is located. 

From a regular terminal (outside of matlab) run: 

%> cd kdtree
%> make


Then inside matlab run: 

%> addpath('kdtree')
%> scvt_test()

Two plots will be generated. the first will show the boundary node distribution.
The second will show the boundary and interior node distribution. 

NOTE: the driver saves the generated point distributions to .mat files. If the 
.mat file exists for a particular number of nodes (e.g., 100 outer boundary and 
100 inner boundary  points), then CVT generation is skipped and the points are 
read from file instead. 

TO MODIFY: 
============

edit scvt_test.m to change parameters for the number of nodes on interior and exterior boundaries, 
change the number of random samples used to calculate mass centroid updates, etc.
