This test generates weights for projected surface gradient of the sphere and approximates the xsfc derivative of the 3,2 spherical harmonic. Then it checks the rel l1, l2 and linf errors of the approximation vs the indirect method of generating the weights. 

Note: the direct method is when we put the projection operator on the RHS of the weight system. The indirect method is when we form a linear combination of the unprojected gradient operator weights. 

Also, I found that the unprojected operator weights, when converted into projected gradient operator weights need to be NEGATIVE in order to calculate the correct gradient. When I do this, the weights are remarkably precise: 1e-6 rel error in approximation for n=101. (< 1e-11 difference in error compared to the direct method of computing weights. What does this tell me? Well, for the 3D spherical shell we will be computing weights for unprojected gradient and laplacian on the interior, but we would also typically need projected weights for the boundaries. However, this test shows us that we DON'T need to calculate the projected weights and occupy MORE memory. Instead we can assemble the projected weights as necessary )
